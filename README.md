# Matt's Spikes

This repository contains a public log of all the spikes that I am currently exporing.

A spike in software development refers to a short period of time during which a developer or team of developers works on a specific task or feature in order to gain a better understanding of it. The goal of a spike is to answer specific questions or to explore a solution to a problem, rather than to produce working code. Spikes can be used to gain knowledge about new technologies or to test out different approaches to solving a problem before committing to a specific implementation.
